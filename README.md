# ALX-low_level_programming

## Learning Objectives
At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

### General

* Why C programming is awesome
* Who invented C
* Who are Dennis Ritchie, Brian Kernighan and Linus Torvalds
* What happens when you type gcc main.c
* What is an entry point
* What is main
* How to print text using printf, puts and putchar
* How to get the size of a specific type using the unary operator sizeof
* How to compile using gcc
* What is the default program name when compiling with gcc
* What is the official C coding style and how to check your code with betty-style
* How to find the right header to include in your source code when using a standard library function
* How does the main function influence the return value of the program
* What functions, pointers, structs, headers, macros etc. are

## Requirements

### Technologies

* Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
* All files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89

### Code

* All your files should end with a new line
* There should be no errors and no warnings during compilation
* Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl

## More Info

### Betty linter

To run the Betty linter just with command betty <filename>:

* Go to the Betty repository
* Clone the repo to your local machine
* cd into the Betty directory
* Install the linter with sudo ./install.sh
* Once saved, exit file and change permissions to apply to all users with chmod a+x betty
* Move the betty file into /bin/ directory or somewhere else in your $PATH with sudo mv betty /bin/

You can now type betty <filename> to run the Betty linter!
